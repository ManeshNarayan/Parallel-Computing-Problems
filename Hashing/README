Here, we have implemented Hashing (Quadratic Probing) through pthreads.

We have achieved parallelization between all the processes happening on Hash table by making locks corresponding to each entry of hash table rather than the table as whole.

Whenever rehashing is performed , no other process gets the chance to run and this is achieved by polling

a) paraHASH is for parallel purpose and gets input from test and has 8 threads and 8,000,000 random entries being generated.
b) seqHash is for sequential purpose and it takes input from what queries are generated by parallel one.
