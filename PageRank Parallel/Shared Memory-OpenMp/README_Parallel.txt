This is the implmentation of PAGERANK in OpenMp. Datasets are based on the assumption that every webpage will have 15 outbound links on an average(except for the 10 page case, which assumes 5 outbound links per page). The data has also been processed to remove self-links. The test files are named according to the number of webpages.
