The program assumes that all files have names in the format "File(i).txt", where i is a variable ranging from 0 to N-1.
Parallelization has been achieved using omp library.

The first problem aims to find the longest common subsequence and then compute the intersection of all the input files.
The executable lcs runs the code sequentially and lcsparallel runs the code in parallel.

No speedup was found due to massive overheads involved in threads.
