# Parallel-Computing-Problems

This repository contains the code for the parallelized implementations of some common problems. The technologies used for parallelizing vary.
The problems include : 
  Longest Common Subsequence Problem using OpenMP
  Hashing with quadratic probing using pthreads
  PageRank Computation using MPI (Distributed memory) and OpenMP (Shared memory)
